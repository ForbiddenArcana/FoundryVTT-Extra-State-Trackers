# FoundryVTT-Extra-State-Trackers
This module adds additional counters to the first page of the Foundry DnD5e default character sheet, just above the Exhaustion tracker. Currently, these counters offer no automated functionality. A future version might automatically implement Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft Stress mechanic using the Stress tracker.
